    <h1>About Myself</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
    <p>I have been happily married to my wife Sandy, for 8 years this year. We have a 6 year old little girl, who is our pride and joy. I enjoy water skiing, mountain biking, 
        camping, and gaming. The best place to do both water skiing and camping is Flaming Gorge. We have amazing mountain ranges to go mountain biking here 
        in Utah, and gaming is a good way to distract some from the stresses of daily life.

    <div class="body">
    <p>I have enjoyed reading books about all kinds of topics, from History to fantasy. Due to my joy of reading I have enjoyed reading about our past. American history
        and how we are where we are today has been a intersting subject for the last half decade for me. Ever since I was a boy my father and older brother would talk about
        muscle cars and luxuirous models. I have tried to keep up with the change in cars and the technologies of today. last I have always had a fascination with Computers
        as they are what allows us to connect to the rest of the world.
